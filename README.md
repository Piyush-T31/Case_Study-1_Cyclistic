# Case study 1 Google Analytics 
This capstone project is for the Google Analytics Certificate where I study a particular dataset and present my findings. 

The case study 1 is a fictitious scenario based on a bike-share company in Chicago.   


## Documentation

### Scenario 

I am junior data analyst working for the marketing team at Cyclistic, the company. I need to get some insights on how casual and annual riders use Cyclistic differently so as to increase the number of annual memberships. I need to analyze and present my findings so that the company can make some data-driven decisions.

### About the company

It was launched in 2016. The prgram features 5800 bicycles and 600 docking stations and even includes  reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making it more inclusive. The company believes that converting casual members to annual members will help to grow more.

I will follow the Case Study roadmap given by the Google Analytics course in order to answer the key business questions.

| What tools are you choosing and why?                             | To be able to clean and filter large dataset, it is better to use BigQuery and SQL.                                                                                       |
| What steps have you taken to ensure that your data is clean?     | I have checked that the data was well-formatted and the datatypes of each columns are appropriate.                                                                        |
| How can you verify that your data is clean and ready to analyze? | I have checked that the data is recognizable and usable in my database. I have checked if the relevant data had no errors and transformed the data for further analyzing. |

I have added a ride_length column to be able to know each riders' usage duration. I have also added a week_of_day column to be able to analyze the dataset for each day of the week. Both were done in Google Sheets. The processed data is saved in the Processed data subfolder.
