# Case study 1 Google Analytics 
This capstone project is for the Google Analytics Certificate where I study a particular dataset and present my findings. 

The case study 1 is a fictitious scenario based on a bike-share company in Chicago.   


## Documentation

### Scenario 

I am junior data analyst working for the marketing team at Cyclistic, the company. I need to get some insights on how casual and annual riders use Cyclistic differently so as to increase the number of annual memberships. I need to analyze and present my findings so that the company can make some data-driven decisions.

### About the company

It was launched in 2016. The prgram features 5800 bicycles and 600 docking stations and even includes  reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making it more inclusive. The company believes that converting casual members to annual members will help to grow more.
